2.long
3.short
4.double
5.float
6.byte
7.char
8.boolean


 short   seatingCapacity=5;
 byte   engine=1;
 String   color="Red";
  char  carFirstLetter='R';
   int  regNumber=82323;
  float  fuelCapacity=75.23443;
   double range=344345.343434;
  boolean  carIsPuncture=false;

Class Name-Pascal notations
    first letter should be capital 
 when we have multiple words the second word init should be capital such as PrimeNumber

Variablename ,Method name ,Object Name: CamelCase
first letter should be lowerCase
 when we have multiple words the second word init should be capital such as regNumber

Variables:
       A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. 

Syntax for variable Declaration:
